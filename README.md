---

## Development Notes

### Challenges Encountered 🚧

1. **Localhost 404 Errors**
   - **Cause**: Vite expected `index.html` in `public/`, but it was mistakenly placed in the root.
   - **Fix**: Moved `index.html` into the root directory and ensured correct project structure.

2. **Vite Not Loading**
   - **Cause**: Conflicting Vite version or missing dependencies.
   - **Fix**: Clean install and port change detection.

3. **Missing Image Rendering**
   - **Cause**: Background image placement in hero banner required careful positioning.
   - **Fix**: Absolute/relative layout with Tailwind and flexbox.

4. **Font Configuration Not Applying**
   - **Cause**: Misnamed font class or missing import from Google Fonts.
   - **Fix**: Imported Bangers and Poppins properly and extended Tailwind config.

5. **Animations Not Working**
   - **Cause**: Incorrect import or Framer Motion not installed.
   - **Fix**: Ran `npm install framer-motion` and ensured correct component usage.
6. **Hero image not displaying correctly**
   - **Fix**:** Used bg-cover bg-center flex justify-end for image alignment and responsiveness.

   ### Other fixes:
   - Tailwind not applying due to incorrect content paths → Fixed
   - JSX structure breaking Framer Motion → Fixed with proper <motion> wrapping

## 📈 Performance & Optimization

- I plan to deploy the project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to take advantage of its fast global CDN, optimized static rendering, and seamless integration with React for improved performance and near-instant load times.
- Lazy loading sections and background images (in progress)
- Scroll-triggered animations only activate when in view
- Hero image and components styled to maximize visual appeal without excessive asset weight

---

### New Features Added ✨

- **Loading Screen Animation** with custom logo and enhanced effects
- **Stripe Payment Integration** for secure ticket purchases
- **Multi-page Routing** with React Router for tickets and success pages
- **Performance Optimizations** with code splitting and optimized animations
- **Enhanced Logo Integration** as favicon and loading animation
- **Production-Ready Configuration** for Replit deployment

---

## 🚀 Stripe Integration

The application now includes full Stripe payment processing for ticket sales:

- **Frontend**: Stripe Checkout integration with React
- **Backend**: Server-side API routes for secure payment processing
- **Security**: Environment variables for API keys
- **Success Flow**: Post-purchase success page with order confirmation

### Payment Features
- Multiple ticket tiers (VIP, General Admission, Early Bird)
- Secure checkout process
- Order confirmation and success handling
- Test mode integration for development

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Vendor and animation chunks separated for faster loading
- **Optimized Animations**: BBQ flame glow effects with `will-change` for better performance
- **Asset Optimization**: Favicon integration and image loading optimization
- **CSS Performance**: Reduced animation complexity in development environment

---

## 🔧 Technical Challenges Faced

### Major Challenges

1. **Vercel Deployment Issues**
   - **Problem**: Server-side API routes not supported on static hosting
   - **Challenge**: Stripe integration requires backend functionality
   - **Solution**: Migrated to Replit for full-stack deployment capability

2. **Payment Processing Architecture**
   - **Problem**: Secure handling of Stripe secret keys in frontend-only environment
   - **Challenge**: GitHub Pages cannot handle server-side environment variables
   - **Solution**: Implemented proper backend API routes with secure key management

3. **Animation Performance Issues**
   - **Problem**: Complex glow animations causing slow rendering in tickets section
   - **Challenge**: Background glows impacting development environment performance
   - **Solution**: Optimized CSS animations with `will-change` and reduced complexity

### Minor Challenges

1. **DOM Nesting Warnings**
   - **Issue**: SplitWords component creating nested div elements within paragraph tags
   - **Status**: Identified through console logs, structural optimization in progress

2. **Port Configuration**
   - **Issue**: External port access configuration for preview functionality
   - **Solution**: Updated .replit configuration with proper port forwarding

3. **Asset Path Management**
   - **Issue**: Logo integration across favicon and loading screen
   - **Solution**: Centralized asset management with proper path resolution

4. **Development vs Production Builds**
   - **Issue**: Build optimization for faster loading times
   - **Solution**: Implemented manual chunks in Vite configuration

### Deployment Considerations

**Why Not Vercel?**
A deployed Vercel version is [available here](https://mumas-mazing-barbeque-8exqclr89-mumas-projects.vercel.app/). While Vercel excels at front-end hosting, it presented several limitations for this full-stack implementation:
- Inadequate support for dynamic API routes and backend logic
- Server-side capabilities required for Stripe payment processing were restricted
- Environment variable security concerns for payment keys
- Overall, it lacked the robust back-end infrastructure needed to deploy full-stack apps

**Replit Advantages:**
- Full-stack deployment with server-side functionality
- Secure management of environment variables
- Built-in development and production environments
- Smooth integration with the existing codebase for streamlined development and testing

---

---

## 🚀 Recent Deployment Challenges & Solutions

### Asset Loading & Path Resolution

**Challenge**: Fire icon and other assets not loading properly in production
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent naming conventions (fire_icon.png vs fire-icon.png) and improper import patterns
- **Solution**: Standardized asset naming and moved critical assets to public folder for direct path access
- **Implementation**: Used `/fire-icon.png` pattern matching the loading screen logo approach

### Performance Optimization

**Challenge**: Complex glow animations causing performance issues in development
- **Root Cause**: Heavy CSS animations with multiple shadow effects
- **Solution**: Optimized animation complexity and added `will-change` properties for better rendering
- **Result**: Smoother scroll performance and reduced development lag

### Multi-Environment Configuration

**Challenge**: Coordinating frontend and backend development workflows
- **Solution**: Implemented parallel workflow configuration:
  - Frontend dev server on port 3002
  - Backend API server running simultaneously
  - Proper port forwarding for external access

### Production Deployment Considerations

**Why Replit Over Other Platforms:**
- **Full-stack Support**: Unlike static hosting (GitHub Pages), Replit handles both frontend and backend
- **Environment Security**: Secure handling of Stripe API keys and environment variables
- **Integrated Development**: Seamless transition from development to production
- **Port Management**: Built-in port forwarding and external access configuration

This project deepened understanding of Vite + React workflows, Tailwind theming, animated UIs, and the importance of checking structural integrity during local setup.

**Key Technical Insights:**
- Asset path consistency is crucial for production deployment
- Parallel development workflows improve full-stack productivity  
- Animation performance optimization requires careful balance between visual impact and smooth execution
- Environment-specific configuration prevents deployment surprises
